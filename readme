    Very powerful brainfuck compiler with only one modification since i don't get at all
    how loops works in brainfuck; Some loops are used until the pointer reaches the zero
    value, others until the enter key is pressed, so to solve that problem two types of
    loops were implemented. Use "[]" when want to do a loop until the value be zero, use
    "()" until the enter key is pressed.

    All brainfuck codes were taken from Daniel B Cristofani's page, thank you so much
    for your bf code and those amazing programs.

    COMPILER IS NOT DONE AT ALL YET, SOME PROGRAMS DOES NOT COMPILE CORRECTLY AND MAY
    SOME IMPROVMENTS CAN BE DONE.
