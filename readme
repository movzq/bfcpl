    Very powerful brainfuck compiler with only one modification since i don't get at all
    how loops works in brainfuck; Some loops are used until the pointer reaches the zero
    value, others until the enter key is pressed, so to solve that problem two types of
    loops were implemented. Use "[]" when want to do a loop until the value be zero, use
    "()" until the enter key is pressed.

    All brainfuck codes were taken from Daniel B Cristofani's page, thank you so much
    for your bf code and those amazing programs.

    Some programs needs too much memory, if you want to use more or less bytes put the
    number of bytes you want after the filename to compile, the number by default is
    30'000.
